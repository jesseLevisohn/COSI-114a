This folder contains homework assignment from the course COSI 114a - Fundamentals of Natural Language Processing I

Project descriptions:
  HW1: Use the Counter and defaultdict classes to implement counters and probability distributions and will write functions to extract and count n-grams.
  HW2: 1. Compute bigram and trigram probabilities given input sequences
       2. Use those probabilities to generate new sequences and compute the probability of sequences.
  HW3: Implement a naive Bayes classifier and apply it to the tasks of sentence segmentation and sentiment analysis.
  HW4: Implement a Hidden Markov Model part of speech tagger
